Seng462 Project
===============

Project for SENG462 from UVIC

### Description
Teams are to design and program a full scale distributed system for a simulated stock broker company.

### Note
Uploaded the entire project to showcase my project. It looks really messy and not well documented because I did this entire project alone while I took another 2 heavy programming courses at the same time... However, this system works and was the fastest in my class in terms of throughput: 10659 transactions per second, while the second best was about 3000 transactions per second.
